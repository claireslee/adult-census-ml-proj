I will be predicting an adult's income, specifically whether an individual's income exceeds a certain threshold ($50,000/year). The label will be 'income_binary'. This is a supervised learning problem because we have labeled data to train the model. Specifically, it is a binary classification problem, as the label has two possible categories: <=50K and >50K. Features may include 'age', 'workclass', 'education', 'education-num', 'occupation', 'sex_selfID', and 'hours-per-week'.

    "Regarding data preparation, I was able to complete in this in part 3 (above). To begin, I made my label into a binary variable - instead of making the feature's value <=50k or >50k, I made it True or False on whether or not the income_binary was <=50k. Also, I addressed missingness by replacing missing values for two features with the calculated means. Additionally, I performed feature engineering by implementing one-hot encoding on categorical features. This addressed missingness for columns with object values and also helped in renaming features and labels for clearer data analysis. I realized that for the one-hot encoding, doing it to the native-country would create too many unnecessary rows so I also changed it into a binary value of whether the person was in the US or not, as majority of the data points were of adults in the US. Following this process, yes, I have a new feature list. I decided to keep all of the features - however, this is something I will reconsider when trying to improve my model's performance. I decided on using the *Decision Tree* model as it is great when it comes to handling nonlinearity, interpretability, and identifying feature importance. I will be training each model on the training set (X_train, y_train) and make sure to validate and tune hyperparameters to improve the model. Hopefully this process will produce a model that generalizes well to new data. \n"
